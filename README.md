# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This page is an example study guide template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can be used by students to keep notes and is formatted specifically based on the topics discussed in the UCF Coding Bootcamp prework modules. The page also contains script that can suggest a random topic for study when the user inspects the console. I created this to better understand HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To record new notes in the study guide, add list elements to the body under an appropriate topic header (HTML notes should go under the HTML topic header). If you would like the page to suggest a topic for study, inspect the console. You can reload the page to see new suggestions.
